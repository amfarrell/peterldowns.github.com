# What does it mean to grow up?

Does growing up mean...

* Loving your family?
* Working at a full time job?
* Taking pride in your work?
* Living in your own apartment?
* Having a savings account?
* Moving into your own apartment?
* Giving money to charity?
* Having friends who you like, but don't confide in?
* Wishing you worked out more, but never taking the time to do so?
* Feeling content with a night in watching Netflix?
* Realizing that some things are outside of your control?


**Do adults know what they're doing?**

When do you get a handle on it? I'm 19, and I don't know what's going on.  I'm
working because I like to, and I'm going to go to school because I want to, but
I don't really understand "why" I do what I do. Is there some deeper logic that
will reveal itself to me on my 21st birthday? I suspect not, but somehow a lot
of other people seem to have got it together.

A lot of my decisions still come "from the gut". I still do things because they
might be funny to look back on one day. I listen to the music that I listened
to in highschool. I have friends across the country who I talk to over
Facebook. But I don't know what it will feel like to be an "adult."

I always feel like I'm a step behind compared to my older friends, my parents,
my coworkers. I get stressed more easily; people refer to me as "kid."
Sometimes they apologize afterwards, but only when I point it out.

I've grown up over the past couple of years: I'm better at making decisions;
I'm better at talking to people; I'm better at getting my work done on time.
But I can't point to anything in particular that's made me more "adult" other
than my age.

Adults of the world — what do you think? Is there some secret I'm missing out
on? When did you grow up?
