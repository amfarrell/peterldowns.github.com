                    <h1>State of the Blog 2012</h1>
<h3>What's new?</h3>
<p>Things have changed since I first started this blog. I've changed the layout a little bit (and plan on changing it some more). I've written a few things, and even posted them. The most radical change is that I've switched from dynamically generating the site to generating the site's layout once, then only serving the static content.</p>
<h3>Am I using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="http://ringce.com/hyde">Hyde</a>?</h3>
<p>No. I'm using a custom site generator that I've worked on a little bit. It's extremely basic, and I'll eventually try to fix it up and do a write-up, but right now it works and that's all I need it to do.</p>
<h3>What's the future look like?</h3>
<p>I want to rewrite the design to be much more spartan. Also, I'd like to add a theme switcher, improve the static generator, and incorporate some more responsive design to make the site look better in general. </p>
<p>Oh, yeah, and I want to write more, too.</p>
