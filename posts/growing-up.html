<p>Does growing up mean...</p>
<ul>
<li>Loving your family?</li>
<li>Working at a full time job?</li>
<li>Taking pride in your work?</li>
<li>Living in your own apartment?</li>
<li>Having a savings account?</li>
<li>Moving into your own apartment?</li>
<li>Giving money to charity?</li>
<li>Having friends who you like, but don't confide in?</li>
<li>Wishing you worked out more, but never taking the time to do so?</li>

<p><strong>Do adults know what they're doing?</strong></p>
<p>When do you get a handle on it? I'm 19, and I don't know what's going on.  I'm
working because I like to, and I'm going to go to school because I want to, but
I don't really understand "why" I do what I do. Is there some deeper logic that
will reveal itself to me on my 21st birthday? I suspect not, but somehow a lot
of other people seem to have got it together.</p>
<p>A lot of my decisions still come "from the gut". I still do things because they
might be funny to look back on one day. I listen to the music that I listened
to in highschool. I have friends across the country who I talk to over
Facebook. But I don't know what it will feel like to be an "adult."</p>
<p>I always feel like I'm a step behind compared to my older friends, my parents,
my coworkers. I get stressed more easily; people refer to me as "kid."
Sometimes they apologize afterwards, but only when I point it out.</p>
<p>I've grown up over the past couple of years: I'm better at making decisions;
I'm better at talking to people; I'm better at getting my work done on time.
But I can't point to anything in particular that's made me more "adult" other
than my age.</p>
<p>Adults of the world &#8212;&#160;what do you think? Is there some secret I'm missing out
on? When did you grow up?</p>
