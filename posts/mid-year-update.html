        <h1>Mid-Year Update</h1>
<p>I recently wrote about <a href="/posts/gap-years-part-1.html">the beginning of my gap years
experience</a>, which described the events that took place
from April to September 2012. I'm still not done writing about the next part of
my adventure, but in the meantime I wanted to share what I've been working on
recently. Last week, MIT sent me an email asking me to "detail" my time away
from school. In the interest of publishing my work more regularly, I'd like to
share my response below.</p>
<h3>The Update</h3>
<p>Hello to everyone at the gap year office,</p>
<p>I'm following the instructions I received last week and writing in to detail
my past year and intent to enroll. I do intend to enroll at MIT this coming
Fall (2014.) It will take more than a sentence to describe what I've been
doing since September.</p>
<p>I decided to take a second gap year because the company I worked for
(<a href="https://locu.com">Locu</a>, a startup focused on helping restaurants publish
their information online) was in the process of being acquired by
<a href="https://godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> (a private company that sells domains, web
hosting, and other related products.) The paperwork was finished by the first
week of September; since then I've helped perform the integration work
required to merge the two companies in the real world.</p>
<p>Our goal was to re-work our product and focus on distributing business
information in an effort to appeal to all types of small businesses, not just
restaurants, and to integrate this new product as one piece of GoDaddy's
software suite. In particular, I integrated our authentication systems &#8212; now,
only a single GoDaddy account is required to access our product. I helped
design the project at a high level; worked with GoDaddy's internal
authentication teams to ensure that they could support our needs; wrote and
tested all of the code necessary for the integration; completed the project
on schedule and to specification.</p>
<p>Outside of that project, I've written code for a bunch of other aspects of the
business, but I think some of the most interesting experiences I've had have
been related to general skills. I've learned a lot about managing projects and
how to structure the work ahead of time in order to make sure everything is
completed in-time and correctly. I've learned more about working with other
teams that have competing political goals. I think that I have continued to
improve my communication and interpersonal skills in general. Oh, and I
<a href="https://github.com/locu/djoauth2">open-sourced some of the code I've created</a>.</p>
<p>In part thanks to my work, we managed to have a successful re-launch (two weeks
ago!) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WycoJMKzXZ4">The commercial we ran in the Super
Bowl</a> was well-received and <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/products/business-marketing.aspx">the
product</a> is selling
well.</p>
<p>I'm excited to continue my work until coming to MIT in the fall! Please let me
know if you have any other questions about what I've been doing.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Peter</p>
<h3>Post Script</h3>
<p>As usual, I've left a lot out. In particular, I would like to make it clear
that I've received a tremendous amount of help from my coworkers. I am unable
to point to a project I worked on entirely by myself. There are too many to
thank but each of my coworkers has helped me grow as a programmer and as a
person. If you're reading this: thank you!</p>
<p>I'd also like to mention that the most interesting part of this experience by
far has been seeing what it's like for a startup to get acquired. My intuition
tells me that no two acquisitions are the same, but this one has been exciting.
Sure, it's been frustrating in some ways, but on the whole I consider it a
success. The topic deserves its own post; maybe I'll publish one soon?</p>
