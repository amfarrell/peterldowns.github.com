						<h1>My experience with alcohol poisoning</h1>
<hr />
<p>I got drunk with some friends.
They're older than me - I met them through my school's Science Olympiad team - but we've been good friends for the past couple of years.
We've gotten together and had a couple of beers before, but this night we tried drinking hard liquor: tequila and whiskey.</p>
<p>It did not end well.</p>
<p>Being older, they've both had more experience drinking. Normally, I only drink a few beers, and I make sure to have lots of food and water. Keep in mind, I rarely drink - I'm under the legal age, and I don't feel the need to get drunk very often - but I do drink at parties or with my friends on occasion. Never this much, though. My friends and I drank and talked for around three hours.</p>
<p>During this time, I had 5 shots of tequila and 2 of whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>This was a terrible decision.</strong></p>
<p>I got very drunk, very quickly. I didn't eat any food or drink any water, and I hadn't eaten a large dinner. This is pretty much the worst combination possible. Too much liquor with not enough food - your body's worst nightmare.</p>
<p>The next day, I couldn't hold any food down, and threw up around four times. The fourth time included some blood. It was very scary. I've never been hungover before, so I didn't know what to expect, but damn, blood? I was unhappy, had a headache, felt feverish, and was throwing up blood.</p>
<p>I talked to my parents, who had to leave their dinner party and come home. I ended up OK - I felt a lot better after that last episode of vomiting, but as I'm writing this (two days later) my stomach still hurts a little bit.</p>
<p>In itself, this wasn't that unique an experience. People poison themselves with alcohol every weekend. People die. I didn't, but if I had kept drinking I could have.</p>
<p>I'm writing this because no one should poison themselves drinking, ever. I've taken a couple of years of health class in school. In retrospect, I've been taught not to do exactly what I did. I've had warnings from my teachers, from my friends, from my parents. But I ended up drinking to the point of self-harm.</p>
<p>I wasn't trying to. I don't really like being drunk, and I don't have a death wish. I'm usually an intelligent person, and I don't regularly flirt with danger. But despite this, I still got hurt. So I'm writing up my experience to try to help others learn from my mistake. Seriously, be safe when you're drinking, or don't drink at all. You may think that you're safe when you drink. You may even actually be safe when you drink. But like Mad Eye Moody is fond of saying,</p>
