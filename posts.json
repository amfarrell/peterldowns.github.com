I'm going to try to update it pretty often; for the past year I've been keeping a list of ideas about which I'd like to write.</p>\n<h3>Why?</h3>\n<p>I've been meaning to start a blog for a while. I haven't gone through with it -- I never really liked tumblr, or blogger, or any other blogging system. I think that writing is important, and that I should start contributing something online instead of just reading posts on <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com\">hacker news</a> and <a href=\"http://boingboing.net\">boingboing</a>. Plus, writing is fun, and I want to become better at it.</p>\n<p>So, here's the blog.</p>\n<h3>How?</h3>\n<p>I'm using <a href=\"http://bottlepy.org\">bottle.py</a> to deal with <code>HTTP</code> requests. CSS3 and the <a href=\"cssgrid.net\">1140px grid</a> make the layout pretty simple. </p>\n<p>The posts are all written in Markdown and converted using the python <a href=\"http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/\">markdown module</a> on pypi. The HTML for each post is stored in one large JSON dictionary which is queried when you come to the site. I thought about using a database but really there's no reason to do so.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to look at it (or even contribute a post!), <a href=\"https://github.com/peterldowns/website\">all of the code is available on my github</a>.</p>",
