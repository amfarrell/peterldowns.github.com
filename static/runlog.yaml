  time-of-day: 5:00 PM
  note: Super hilly, which made me feel crappy. I also ate two bowls of count
        chocula cereal at around 4:00 PM, so I really didn't feel all that
        great.

  time-of-day: 5:20 PM
  note: Ran to City College and did 2 miles on the track at exactly 6:40 pace.
        Took the long way there and back because I wanted to hit over 30
        minutes. My groin was hurting a little bit on the right side.

  time-of-day: 11:45 AM
  note: Ran up to the road at the Bernal Heights. Very steep and hilly. I
        stretched out my groin a little ahead of time, and although it hurt a
        little on the uphill it was fine for the most part.

  time-of-day: 5:00 PM
  note: Ran over past the water tower, but continued running until I came upon
        a highschool track with a beautiful view. I hopped two fences and ran a
        quarter mile on the track. Coming off of the track I ran past two
        teachers who seemed to be leaving; their backs were turned and they
        didn't notice me. The whole day was super gray, misty, and humid; it
        was silent, and as if we were inside a fogbank.

  distance: '4.7 miles'
  weather: perfect, sunny, cool
  terrain: hilly
  feel: 8
  time-of-day: 8:55 AM
  note: Ran up Mission and to the top of the Bernal Heights. I took the
        escarpment approach and ran up the dirt path instead of running the
        road the whole way up. It was absolutely gorgeous at the top. I felt
        extremely good the whole time, even though the hills were pretty rough.

  time-of-day: 9:00 AM
  note: Ran to the city college track, where I did 1.5 miles in 10:30ish (right
        around a 7:00 mile pace.) It was a nice day, but I slept in a little so
        now I'm going to be late for work. I could feel myself getting happier
        the moment I decided to go for the run.

  time-of-day: 11:15 AM
  note: Did the run past the water tower to the highschool track, where I ran a
        half mile. Jumping the fence definitely twinged my groin, which hasn't
        been feeling fully healthy. It's a beautiful, warm, day, and I took my
        shirt off about a mile and a half into the run. I forgot how great that
        feels!

  time-of-day: 09:40 AM
  note: Longer run today with Jack Curtis! He saw me at the XX concert last
        night and we caught up and decided to run this morning. I met him at
        his hotel (Hotel Monaco) on Taylor and Geary right near Union Square.
        We ran down Taylor until we hit the embarcadero, then looped around and
        picked up Market -> Sutter -> the hotel. It was a beautiful day and I
        had a great time running with him and talking -- so much better than
        running alone.  He's doing really well, and is about 3 weeks into his
        own training, so the pace was a little fast for me and I had to slow
        down coming uphill at the end of the run.

  time-of-day: 8:50 AM
  note: First run out of the new apartment! Ran down Gough to the Marina, then
        ran along until I hit 16 minutes and turned around. My groin was
        hurting again on the way back so I stopped and stretched at around 24
        minutes. I didn't make it all the way back to the apartment -- Gough
        gets crazy steep coming up from the marina, and my groin started
        hurting on the climb even after I stretched. I feel bad about not
        making it back up, but I'd already done 32ish minutes, and I had been
        aiming for 30 after yesterday's longer run with Jack.

  weather: foggy, warm, humid
  terrain: hilly, flat
  feel: 6
  time-of-day: 8:50 AM
  note: Exact same run as yesterday, but a little further and a little faster.
        My groin felt good pretty much until the uphill at the end. Coming back
        it twinged a little, and now (2 hours later) it doesn't hurt but it
        does feel a little discomfortable. I'm going to try and get it seen by
        someone soon, and I think I'll call Mr. Klick and ask him about it.

  weather: sunny, hot, windy
  terrain: hilly, flat
  feel: 7
  time-of-day: 1:30 PM
  note: Did the same marina run that I've been doing. It's nice and flat except
        for the huge uphill at the end, and I get fantastic views of Alcatraz,
        the Bay, and the Golden Gate.  Today I saw one of the Oracle boats,
        huge and far away. Only a very minor irritation of my groin. I talked
        with Mr. Klick on Tuesday and he said that because it's an old injury
        (from soccer freshman year) I'll probably feel it for the rest of my
        life. He remembers that I have always had issues with it at the
        beginning of training, but that it will most likely work itself out as
        the microtears heal up. He approves of getting it worked on. He also
        said that he was pretty excited for seeing what I can do if I train
        consistently, which is great motivation for me.

  note: Same old Marina run. Feels good, man! Can't wait to explore a little
        once the weekend comes. I should mention that I've been really
        congested all week, and that I have a ton of mucus in my system, which
        makes the runs a little awful at first.

  time-of-day: 5:00 PM
  note: Did the Marina run, but went a little further this time. I turned
        around at the dividing point of Crissy field. I think running to the
        base of the bridge and back will end up being around 8 miles; I'm
        excited for being able to do that regularly. Today's run was not so
        much fun on the way out because there was an extremely strong wind that
        I was running directly into. Turning around was a huge relief. Felt
        pretty good -- little bit of groin stress on the uphill on the way back
        (came back on Franklin instead of Gough this time.)
