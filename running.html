Right now, walking around, it twinges a little bit but not much or consistently. My shins felt very sore and tight for portions of the run, and I'm not sure if it's shin-splint-related or if it's due to subconscious compensation for my knee issue. After my run I did 3:30 of core exercise and then rolled out my legs. After my shower I stretched, too. Hopefully the stretching, icing, medicine, and new shoes will help me recover quickly. </td>

So that sucked, I really didn't get much sleep. During the run the back of my left knee started hurting again really badly, and I think because of how I was compensating my left shin started to feel like it was getting shin splints. This is the worst, I feel shitty. I rolled everything out after the run and took some acetaminophen and iced for an hour, but even walking is stressing my knee now. I'm going to email coach tomorrow and see if he has anything to say about it. Fuck. </td>

            <td style="width: 100%"> Normal Marina run. Took yesterday off and it seemed to help a lot with my cough, which didn't affect me during the run at all! Did not help with my knee &#8212; when I strike with my left foot, the right of the back-side of my knee (where it feels like a tendon or muscle is attached) 'clicks' with a sharp pain. It's not bad enough that I had to stop running, but it affects my stride and is definitely not normal. Even after the run now, walking around I'll feel the same thing when I extend my left leg, bending the knee. I'll have to ask Mr. Klick and Coach Taylor about it, as well as google around. I guess that it's probably related to running a lot after being so inactive for so long, and that it will go away on its own soon. Stretching it out during the run did not help. </td>

I turned around where there's a short climb up to the road that takes you to the bottom of the bridge; it's the second main path intersection on Crissy field.  Legs felt tired, and my groin twinged a little. Studied up a lot earlier on the stuff that Coach Taylor sent out, which helped inspire me a little bit.  I need to get a blood test for iron levels, start taking iron supplements, and figure out a core/lifting schedule to work on. I might also need new shoes, and I need a buy a foam roller. I'm a little worried about how intense this running program is, but at the same time super excited. </td>

I think running to the base of the bridge and back will end up being around 8 miles; I'm excited for being able to do that regularly. Today's run was not so much fun on the way out because there was an extremely strong wind that I was running directly into. Turning around was a huge relief. Felt pretty good -- little bit of groin stress on the uphill on the way back (came back on Franklin instead of Gough this time.) </td>

It's nice and flat except for the huge uphill at the end, and I get fantastic views of Alcatraz, the Bay, and the Golden Gate.  Today I saw one of the Oracle boats, huge and far away. Only a very minor irritation of my groin. I talked with Mr. Klick on Tuesday and he said that because it's an old injury (from soccer freshman year) I'll probably feel it for the rest of my life. He remembers that I have always had issues with it at the beginning of training, but that it will most likely work itself out as the microtears heal up. He approves of getting it worked on. He also said that he was pretty excited for seeing what I can do if I train consistently, which is great motivation for me. </td>

I'm going to try and get it seen by someone soon, and I think I'll call Mr. Klick and ask him about it. </td>

My groin was hurting again on the way back so I stopped and stretched at around 24 minutes. I didn't make it all the way back to the apartment -- Gough gets crazy steep coming up from the marina, and my groin started hurting on the climb even after I stretched. I feel bad about not making it back up, but I'd already done 32ish minutes, and I had been aiming for 30 after yesterday's longer run with Jack. </td>

I met him at his hotel (Hotel Monaco) on Taylor and Geary right near Union Square. We ran down Taylor until we hit the embarcadero, then looped around and picked up Market -&gt; Sutter -&gt; the hotel. It was a beautiful day and I had a great time running with him and talking -- so much better than running alone.  He's doing really well, and is about 3 weeks into his own training, so the pace was a little fast for me and I had to slow down coming uphill at the end of the run. </td>

    "note": "Marina run, after work. I stayed at the office last night, where I slept from 7 AM to 9 AM on the couch. Went home and slept from 10:15 to 12:15. So that sucked, I really didn't get much sleep. During the run the back of my left knee started hurting again really badly, and I think because of how I was compensating my left shin started to feel like it was getting shin splints. This is the worst, I feel shitty. I rolled everything out after the run and took some acetaminophen and iced for an hour, but even walking is stressing my knee now. I'm going to email coach tomorrow and see if he has anything to say about it. Fuck.",

Did not help with my knee \u2014 when I strike with my left foot, the right of the back-side of my knee (where it feels like a tendon or muscle is attached) 'clicks' with a sharp pain. It's not bad enough that I had to stop running, but it affects my stride and is definitely not normal. Even after the run now, walking around I'll feel the same thing when I extend my left leg, bending the knee. I'll have to ask Mr. Klick and Coach Taylor about it, as well as google around. I guess that it's probably related to running a lot after being so inactive for so long, and that it will go away on its own soon. Stretching it out during the run did not help.",
